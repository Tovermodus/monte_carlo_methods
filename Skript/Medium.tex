We chose to make our medium, both rod and surrounding liquid, a changeable parameter to see
the influence of the density difference and the liquid's viscosity on the process. First of all, we see
that depending on the sign of the density difference, we get either sedimentation or a collection and ordering of the particles at that top of the liquid. We primarily used iron and lithium as rod
material as they demonstrate this change of sign when paired up with water as the surrounding
material. Interestingly, while iron has eight times the density of water and lithium is much closer at half of the waterâ€™s density, this does not seem to make a huge difference in the timescales of the
process. Though iron seems to order itself slower, so the tendency is there.\\

As an alternative liquid than water, we choose honey. Our main result there was that the entire process slows down as the higher viscosity dampens movement.
